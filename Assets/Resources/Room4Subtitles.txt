Upon airborne administration of Z-strength sedatives, Subject R-47 was successfully neutralized. @5.5
Though the damage to the lab is reparable, continuing to @2
use this space for experimentation is strongly inadvisable @2.5
given the regenerative nature observed in prior tests on R-47. @3.5

…I couldn’t kill it. @3
I can still taste the gunpowder stuck between my teeth– @3.5
I kept shooting at the thing, and it just–swallowed the bullets and kept on coming, @4
this insatiable colossus, all corkscrew tendons and roving eyes. @6
Like all it could think about was feeding some sort of bottomless hunger. @2.75
[...] @1.5
Once it fell asleep it began to revert to its original size, @2.25
so I dumped the thing in the one cage we have left, @2.75
disposed of what... piecemeal parts were left of the other rats, @2.5
and got the hell out of there, but– @1.75
It’s only a matter of time before it wakes up again. @2.75
And when it does, @2
I know it’ll be hungry still. @3.25
I’ve placed bait throughout the lab to try to lure the thing to trip the alarm system – @3.25
That’ll at least send a ping so we can… take the appropriate measures. @3
